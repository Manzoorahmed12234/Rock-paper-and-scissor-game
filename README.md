# Rock-paper-and-scissor-game
The program plays a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between the player and the computer. The player is prompted to enter their choice, and the computer randomly selects a choice. The program then compares the two choices and determines the winner. The program keeps track of the number of wins for each player and prints the results at the end of the game.
